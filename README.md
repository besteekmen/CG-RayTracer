### Introduction to Computer Graphics - Assignment 5 Release

This release includes the implementations for CG class requested in the Assignment 5.

#### Students:

* Rahul Nittala (7015773)
* Beste Ekmen   (2572855)

#### Development Platform:

* OS: Windows 11
* Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-9300H CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz
* C++ version: C++ 17
* IDE: VStudio 2021

#### Features:
We have implemented all mandatory features and BONUS features requested in this assignment.
Mandatory Features: All
BONUS features: Projective Light Source

***Note:*** We have edited the renderCornellboxA in a_lighting.cpp by replacing three point lights to projective lights to generate the projective light pictures. The originalfile is preserved with additional header for the projective light source. To generate the same image, basically point light sources may be replaced.

#### Theoretical:
We have submitted the theoretical part on MS Teams.

#### Tests:

We have tested our code both on a Windows (development platform) and a Linux system and we have generated the result images in both with no problem.

* Test platform 1: Windows 11, C++ 17.
* Test platform 2: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, C++ 17
